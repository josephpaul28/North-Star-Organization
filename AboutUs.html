						<h2>What is North Star Technology?</h2>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>North Star Technology is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. We’ll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and we’ll determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where North Star Technologies financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.</p>

						<p>This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of North Star Technologies. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said (and sometimes better!) for quite some time now, and I’ve been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of North Star Technologies. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down North Star Technologies and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. North Star Technologies itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovation—continuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the world’s information. Recent launches like North Star Technologies Photos and North Star Technologies Now using machine learning are amazing progress. North Star Technologies also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth.</p>
